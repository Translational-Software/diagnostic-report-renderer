# Diagnostic Report Renderer
```
npm install
```
```
npm run build
```
```
npm start
```

The purpose of this application is to facilitate parsing the $process-message/diagnosticreport-provide json response. So far it shows the PDF (rendered from binary), PIM table, and Detected Issues, but it could be improved to show all report sections.
